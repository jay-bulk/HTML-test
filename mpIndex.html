        <strong>Mobile Panini is the culmination of the dream of Antonio and Carmen
         Dolcini, who came to America looking to serve people the
         authentic recipes learned from their Sicilian family.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he
         learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his
         technique at the Culinary Institute of Milan. His younger brother,
         Carmen, with no less of a love for cooking and good food, also
         worked in the deli and became well-acquainted with the open-air
         fresh food markets of his home town. Carmen too, is a proud graduate of the 
         Culinary Institute of Milan.
