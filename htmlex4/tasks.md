HTML – Exercise 4
Follow the instructions below and edit sdMessier.html and sdEffects.css so that the former renders as shown in sdMessierDone.png.
1. Insert appropriate comments including your name and date in sdMessier.html and sdEffects.css.
2. In sdMessier.html, create links to the sdBase.css, sdLayout.css, and sdEffects.css style sheets.
3. Make the following changes to sdEffects.css:
  - In the Html Styles section, create a style rule for the html element to display the sdBack1.png file as the background image covering the entire browser window. Have the background image fixed so that it does not scroll with the browser widow.
  - In the Body Styles section, create a style rule for the body element that adds the following backgrounds in the order listed:
    - A background containing the night sky image, sdBack2.png,
    - A radial gradient circle with a size extending to the closest corner and placed at the coordinates (40%, 70%) containing the color white stopping at 15% of the gradient followed by the color value rgba(151, 151, 151, 0.5) stopping at 50%,
    - A radial gradient circle also extending to the closest corner and placed at the coordinates (80%, 40%) containing the color white stopping at 15% of the gradient followed by the color value rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) stopping at 30%,
    - A radial gradient extending to the closest side and placed at the coordinates (10%, 20%) containing the color white stopping at 20% of the gradient followed by the color value rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) stopping at 45%,
    - The background color is set to rgb(151, 151, 151)
  - In the Body Styles section, add styles to place box shadows on the left and right borders. Set the color of the first shadow to rgb(31, 31, 31) with horizontal and vertical offsets of 30 pixels and 0 pixels and a blur of 45 pixels. Set the color of the second shadow to rgb(31, 31, 31) with
horizontal and vertical offsets of -30 pixels and 0 pixels and a blur of 45 pixels.
  - In the Navigation List Styles section, format the hypertext links in the body header by creating a style rule that adds a 5-pixel outset border with color value rgb(211, 211, 255).
  - In the Section Left Styles section, create a style rule for the h1 heading in the left section article that changes the text color to rgb(211, 211, 211) and adds a black text shadow with 0-pixel offsets and a blur size of 5 pixels.
  - In the Footer Styles section, create a style rule for the footer element that adds a 2-pixel solid border to the top edge of the footer with a color value of rgb(171, 171, 171).


Save the files to your “W: drive”.
Submit the URL to sdMessier.html.
Let’s assume that student Jane Doe has saved sdMessier.html within a folder called HtmlEx4 under her
public_html folder on “W drive”. The URL for this file would be:
https://cisweb.biz.colostate.edu/cis665/SP24Doe/HtmlEx4/sdMessier.html
